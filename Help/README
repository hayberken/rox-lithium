Baroque is an applet for the ROX Desktop. It shows the battery state of APM
and ACPI systems.

Baroque is written in pure Python, compiling is not needed.
Since version 0.4.0 Baroque is based on apm.py and acpi.py. It should run on
all systems which are supported by apm.py and/or acpi.py and where ROX is
installed.
