Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lithium is an applet for the ROX Desktop. It shows the battery state on systems
that support ACPI, APM (or for PowerMacs PMU) interfaces.

Lithium is written in pure Python, compiling is not needed. 
It is based on Baroque 0.5.1, by Rds and Tilo Riemer.

ICONS
~~~~~
There are some provided themes (easily replaceable).  Most were created by me,
except for Tango which is taken from the GNOME PowerManager applet.

Feel free to make your own icons if mine don't suit your tastes.
